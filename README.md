# Somya Learning Repo

Hii.. I am learning Angular from a Udemy Course. This is a sample application to post updates of what I have learnt.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
